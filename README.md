# OrnnForge
OrnnForge: The Content Creator's Crucible

OrnnForge is an open-source platform that acts as a digital crucible for content creation. It allows creators to throw their raw ideas, media fragments, and inspiration into the forge, where they can be heated, hammered, and combined into something entirely new and powerful.

Just as the mythical demigod Ornn crafts legendary artifacts from base materials, this platform helps you forge your scattered thoughts and assets into polished, impactful content.
